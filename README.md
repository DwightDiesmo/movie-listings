This is a project that was completed as part of the MITx Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. The challenge was to use React components to template each movie card while using Bootstrap. 

### How to Run: 
1. Git Clone this Repository. 
2. `npm install` `npm start` inside the project.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
- Clicking on the movies should take to the actual film or an individual page where the user can grab more information
- Categorizing the movies by genre
- Allow users to rate the movies
